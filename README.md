# Security-Identification-Project-SYSTEMTRON

This project is part of a cybersecurity internship task that demonstrates how to identify potential security threats using tools like **Nmap**, **Wireshark**, and **DVWA** on a vulnerable machine such as **Metasploitable**.

---

## 🧠 Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Identify open ports and running services.
- Capture network packets.
- Access and analyze a vulnerable web app.
- Understand basic threat identification steps.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🐧 Kali Linux (Virtual Machine)
- 🧰 Nmap – for network scanning
- 🦈 Wireshark – for packet capture
- 🌐 DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
- 📷 Screenshots – collected during each step
- 📝 Notepad – for writing the report

## 🚀 Steps Performed

1. **Started Kali Linux** in VM environment.
2. **Scanned Metasploitable IP** using `nmap` to detect services and ports.
3. **Captured packets** using `wireshark` on interface `eth0`.
4. **Logged into DVWA** using:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `password`
5. Collected screenshots for all the above steps.
